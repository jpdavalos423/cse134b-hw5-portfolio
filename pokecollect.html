            <h2>About the Project</h2>
            <p>
              PokeCollect is a web application designed to help collectors
              track, manage, and explore their Pokémon TCG collections. The
              project was developed as part of UCSD’s CSE 110 Software
              Engineering course, where my team and I followed Agile
              methodologies to plan sprints, refine features, and iterate on
              design. Our goal was to build an easy-to-use interface that lets
              collectors view card details, organize their personal collection,
              and monitor market information in a visually engaging dashboard.
            </p>
            <p>
              This project also served as my introduction to collaborative
              software engineering. It strengthened my skills in communication,
              version control workflows, and UI/UX design while working in a
              multi-person team environment.
            </p>

            <h2>Key Features</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Integrated Pokémon TCG API for real-time card information</li>
              <li>Collection management system using LocalStorage</li>
              <li>Responsive, mobile-friendly dashboard layout</li>
              <li>Team-oriented development using Agile methodologies</li>
              <li>Built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS</li>

            <h2>Development Process</h2>
            <p>
              Our team began by writing user stories and organizing them into
              sprint cycles. I focused primarily on UI structure, component
              design, and ensuring a smooth API integration pipeline. We used
              code reviews, usability testing, and iterative feedback to refine
              the dashboard layout and feature set.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through this process, I gained experience with version control
              workflows, team communication strategies, and translating user
              needs into technical implementations.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section class="project-technical">
            <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
            <p>
              The project fetches structured JSON card data from the Pokémon TCG
              API, dynamically populating UI components using JavaScript.
              LocalStorage handles collection state persistence, allowing users
              to revisit their saved cards without a backend.
            </p>
            <p>
              The interface uses CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive layout, and
              the image system employs responsive sources to improve loading
              performance.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section class="project-challenges">
            <h2>Challenges & Solutions</h2>
            <p>
              Managing inconsistent API fields required robust fallback logic to
              ensure the UI could gracefully handle missing attributes.
              Coordination across team branches also involved careful merge
              practices and consistent styling conventions.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section class="project-future">
            <h2>Future Enhancements</h2>
            <p>
              Planned upgrades include cloud-synced collections, advanced
              filtering and sorting options, and price history charts for card
              valuation.
